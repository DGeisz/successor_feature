# Xero2

"Xero" means "I know" in Greek. I like Greek and I like knowing things. Specifically things about mech interpretability. Hence the name ðŸ¤™

### [Neel Nanda MATS Application:](/neel_application/)

This is where I did the actual application project. This contains two versions of effectively the same code. [successor_feature_exploration\_\_raw.py](/neel_application/successor_feature_exploration__raw.py) contains the final messy version of the code after I finished the project. [successor_feature_exploration\_\_clean.py](/neel_application/successor_feature_exploration__clean.py) contains a version of the same code that's cleaned up and most approachable for anyone who wants to replicate my results.

Here's the [application project write-up.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qJCWxkRJd-bOIUF4FAPZtnERw4YN5uxx-zZuSOHWp8c/edit?usp=sharing)


### [Exploratory Notebooks:](/exploratory_notebooks/)

I used these notebooks to explore a variety of different topics in Mech Interp before I began the actual application project. Aside from notebooks that follow Neel Nanda's tutorials, I also have notebooks investigating a dictionary learning algo I came up with several years ago which I call K-Winner Synthesis.
